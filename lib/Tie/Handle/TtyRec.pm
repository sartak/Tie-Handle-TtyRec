=head1 NAME

Tie::Handle::TtyRec - write a ttyrec

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Tie::Handle::TtyRec;
    my $handle = Tie::Handle::TtyRec->new("foo.ttyrec");
    print $handle "hello", "world";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A ttyrec is a format used for recording terminal sessions. Notably, practically
all NetHack games are recorded using ttyrecs. ttyrecs include precise timing
data and can be a little fiddly. This module lets you focus on your
application, instead of making sure your ttyrec headers are perfect.

The usual way to use this module is through its C<new> interface. It will
clobber the file you decide to record to, unless you pass C<< append => 1 >> as
additional arguments to C<new>.

Each argument to print will be put into its own ttyrec frame, using the current
time. So, the following will create three separate frames,

    print $handle "foo", "bar", "baz";

The following will create only one frame,

    print $handle "foo" . "bar" . "baz";
